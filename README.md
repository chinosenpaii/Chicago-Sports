# Chicago-Sports Website
*COMP Database Project @ Loyola University of Chicago
*Worked on by Israel Yarce, Chris Krabbenschimdt, and Chris Hernandez
*Chicago-Sports is a website that shows any upcoming sports games that are being played by Chicago-based teams in any sport. Showing the date, the opponents, and the final score of the game.
*The purpose of the project was to implement a database into a website template already created. Used a little bit of Python to edit the site.
Mostly used MySql and PHPMyAdmin to create a database, store information,and implementing it on the site to illustrate any updates made on the database to reflect on the site.
